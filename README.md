# Closet

Closet is a Bat2EXE computer virus that force restarts your computer a few seconds (like, 20) after you log on.

Please, don't run this program on your Windows host.

Supports Windows 7 --> 11.
It can't run on XP to my knowledge, or Vista.


Obviously only runs on Windows NT-based OSs (i think that's the plural for OS.)
